# apollo-coffee
A REST API Coffee shop website project
This project was created for my Web Design and Programming course

This project utilizes docker images to host pgAdmin4 for postgre as the database and node.js to communicate with the database

You can register, login, make orders and view said orders in the website.

To make this website work, initialize the project with npm init and create the required docker images to host pgAdmin4 for the database to work
